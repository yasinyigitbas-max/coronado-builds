# bugcheck1 status (updated 2026-11-07 ~03:20 UTC)

| Patch | Status |
|---|---|
| 0001-0006 | Done. Full 103-test run: only intended changes (tree_col FAIL→PASS, wardrobe TIMEOUT→FAIL on an outdated check) |
| 0007 traffic lanes | Done. Soak 3 seeds: 0 collisions / red runs; 14/14 CityRide stands. Full run (84/103 done before stop): cityride FAIL→PASS, **test_traffic PASS→FAIL** (1 collision + lane-offset check) |
| 0008 door clearance | Done (live build: 0/198 doorways blocked). Needs re-bake |
| 0009 door open / empty shops | Done (probe: 5/5 doors open on first tap; package shops woken) |
| 0010 traffic fix for test_traffic | Written, **NOT yet tested** |

## Next steps (for the next session)
1. Re-run tests/traffic/test_traffic.gd with 0001-0010: expect 0 collisions, cars_on_lanes PASS.
2. Full 103-test run with 0001-0010; compare with TEST_RESULTS (release) table.
3. Turn-curve fix (straight / kinked connectors), only if Yasin asks.
4. Physics (basic / fuller), only when Yasin says "start physics".
5. Open the pull request bugcheck1 → main for Yasin to merge.
